\section{Goal}
\todo{write out the list below}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Find an effective way to measure and quantify the error/inaccuracy}
	\item{From a single measurement differentiate the own error from the environment's error}
	\item{Publicly share the information about the measured inaccuracy}
	\item{As a swarm: continuously \& collectively improve the knowledge about inaccuracy}
	\item{Find a way to use the knowledge of the inaccuracy to take countermeasures}
\end{itemize}
