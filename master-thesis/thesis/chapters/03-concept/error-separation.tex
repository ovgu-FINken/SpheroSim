\section{Separation of environmental influences from inherent inaccuracy}
\todo{write out the list below}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Error-data get separated by error from environment and error from individual}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Constant/linear error \emph{probably} originates from individual}
		\item{Dynamic error \emph{probably} originates from environment}
		\item{Comparison with existing measurements to statistically improve separation}
	\end{itemize}
	\item{Environmental influences are shared with every other individual}
	\item{Individual error is kept and continually improved}
\end{itemize}
